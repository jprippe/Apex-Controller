This code in development will automatically update Apex aquarium temperature controllers to reflect real-time data updates from NOAA NDBC buoys. Its underlying function is as a web crawling application that scrapes daily updates from a chosen NDBC buoy website (e.g., https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/station_page.php?station=bftn7), calculates representative conditions to implement in the Apex experimental setup, and formats and inputs appropriate code into the Apex online control panel.
